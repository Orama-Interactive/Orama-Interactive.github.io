&lt;p>We made it. After 5 years in development, version 1.0 of Pixelorama is finally here. To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure where to start with this post. I suppose I should thank each and every one of you for contributing, donating, translating, using, providing feedback and reading this post. This would not be possible without you, and the team and I are extremely grateful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama is coming to Steam!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-is-coming-to-steam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 14:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-is-coming-to-steam/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/erevoid/">Erevoid&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since our last update. I hope you didn&amp;rsquo;t miss us! Today, version 0.11.4 is coming out, along with various optimizations and bug fixes. Very few new features, but we definitely recommend you to update. Today is also Orama Interactive&amp;rsquo;s birthday! It&amp;rsquo;s been a wild ride, and we are very glad and honored you have been with us.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.11.3 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.11.3-is-out/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 16:30:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.11.3-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/vs.pxl/">Uch&lt;/a>, one of the artists for v0.11&amp;rsquo;s splash screen artworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Version 0.11.3, another small maintenance update, is here! No new features on this one, but it has very important bug fixes so it is very recommended that you update. Most notably, the previous two versions had a serious issue where using a tool, then switching to another tool and then undoing had no effect. This is now fixed in this version!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.11.2 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.11.2-is-out/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 11:30:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.11.2-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/Roroto_Sic">Roroto Sic&lt;/a>, one of the artists for v0.11&amp;rsquo;s splash screen artworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I know how I mentioned that work is now focused on version 1.0 on the previous blog post, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t forget about 0.x! Version v0.11.2 is a relatively small update, that just mostly fixes a critical bug, but also introduces a couple new features thanks to our contributors. More 0.x versions may follow if more serious issues are found and fixed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.11.1 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.11.1-is-out/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 14:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.11.1-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WishdreamStar">Wishdream&lt;/a>, one of the artists for v0.11&amp;rsquo;s splash screen artworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 0.x versions haven&amp;rsquo;t said their last word yet. Here comes version v0.11.1, with some new features and nice improvements to the user improvements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.11 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.11-is-out/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 17:45:26 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.11-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by Exuvita, one of the artists for v0.11&amp;rsquo;s splash screen artworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After almost nine months, a new version of Pixelorama, version 0.11, is finally out! It might seem like a long time without an update, but we have been working hard these months to make this update amazing, and we are proud to say that this is probably the biggest update so far! At least until version 1.0, which will most likely be the next major version of Pixelorama!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.10.3 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.10.3-is-out/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 17:01:26 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.10.3-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by &lt;a href="https://resite.link/Kalpar">Kalpar&lt;/a>, one of the artists for v0.10&amp;rsquo;s splash screen artworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pixelorama v0.10.3 is out today! Unlike the versions that came before it, it does not contain a lot of new features. Nevertheless, it comes with important UI and UX improvements and polishing, as well as bug fixes, so it is highly encouraged that you update.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.10.2 is out &amp; Voxelorama is open-sourced!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.10.2-is-out/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 15:53:26 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.10.2-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/vs.pxl/">Uch&lt;/a>, one of the artists for v0.10&amp;rsquo;s splash screen artworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today is a special day for Pixelorama. Exactly three years ago, version 0.1 was released and the project was open sourced!

&lt;p>In our previous blog post about Pixelorama v0.10, we teased about an exciting announcement for our 10 years of Orama Interactive anniversary (17 of April 2012- 17 of April 2022). Two months ago we made a peculiar April Fools prank on our Discord server. We announced a Pixelorama extension that converts 2d pixels into 3d voxels, called Voxelorama, and that it would cost $9.99. But the next day, we admitted that this was, in fact, just a prank. Voxelorama will be &lt;strong>free and open-source&lt;/strong>. Got you real good! So yes, Voxelorama is indeed a thing and it will be free. Notice the usage of future tense, but more on that later. Keep on reading to learn how you can get access to Voxelorama right now!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.10.1 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.10.1-is-out/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 16:01:26 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.10.1-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WishdreamStar">Wishdream&lt;/a>, one of the artists for v0.10&amp;rsquo;s splash screen artworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have amazing news for you! A new version of Pixelorama is releasing today, version 0.10.1, with some awesome new features and various changes. Along with that, we are also announcing &lt;strong>Voxelorama&lt;/strong>, an extension for Pixelorama that converts your pixel art into voxel art. For more information on that, you can &lt;a href="../announcing-voxelorama">read this blog post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.10 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.10-is-out/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 16:21:26 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.10-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/Roroto_Sic">Roroto Sic&lt;/a>, one of the artists for v0.10&amp;rsquo;s splash screen artworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hello everyone! We hope you all are doing well. Pixelorama certainly has been! The love and support from the community has been rising, and we are extremely grateful for this. Statistically, we are currently sitting on over 75k downloads and 90k browser plays on itch.io and just a bit less than 3k stars on GitHub.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.9 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.9-is-out/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 16:15:46 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.9-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. Although we have been releasing smaller updates during this time (v0.8.1, v0.8.2 and v0.8.3), we haven&amp;rsquo;t released a big update for some time now. We have been working on this update hard, and we think it&amp;rsquo;s finally time to release it! Pixelorama has also seen progress in statistics. We are currently sitting on over 50k downloads and 52k browser plays on itch.io and 2.1k stars on GitHub.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.8 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.8-is-out/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 13:37:35 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.8-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pixelorama has been growing more and more. After v0.7 was released, we hit over 20k downloads on itch.io, and 1k stars on GitHub. We also got featured in Ask Gamedev&amp;rsquo;s Godot Engine Game Showcase 2020 video.

&lt;p>&amp;hellip;Okay&amp;hellip;? What does that mean? Wasn&amp;rsquo;t it already on the Web?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.7 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.7-is-out/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 12:24:43 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.7-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Art by Wishdream - winner of the first Pixelorama splash screen art contest!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This took a while. Four months have passed since v0.6, the world has changed drastically, and finally v0.7 is ready to be released. During this time however, one thing was increasing; The support we received from all of you. It fills our hearts with joy to see people being excited about Pixelorama, and to see you all make amazing drawings with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.6 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.6-is-out/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 13:33:54 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.6-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Artwork by Erevos&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no words. The support we received for Pixelorama v0.5 was too much to handle! We were definitely not expecting so much people showing their genuine interest in our little software, and spreading the word! A lot of people joined &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/GTMtr8s">our new Discord server&lt;/a>, left their comments on &lt;a href="https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama">Pixelorama&amp;rsquo;s itch.io page&lt;/a> and opened issues on our &lt;a href="https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama">GitHub repository&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-TJ1WcCA6k">Gamefromscratch even made a video on Pixelorama!!!&lt;/a> This was a massive boost to its popularity, and we&amp;rsquo;d like to thank them a lot for their awesome video! We&amp;rsquo;d also like to thank all those who donated through itch.io! Since so many people showed their interest in donating, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/OramaInteractive">we launched a Patreon&lt;/a>, which can grant people some amazing rewards! You can see our quick announcement video here:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.5 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.5-is-out/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2019 01:04:32 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.5-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Major UI overhaul - at last! Artwork by Erevos&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have to say, this update was finished earlier than I expected. If you asked me some weeks ago about when v0.5 would be released, I&amp;rsquo;d say early 2020! Fortunately for all of us I was wrong, and it released just in time for something new that Orama is doing! What are we doing, you ask? I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know soon, so make sure to read this blog post until the end. But for now, the changelog:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pixelorama v0.4 is out!</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.4-is-out/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2019 22:27:32 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/pixelorama-0.4-is-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>These last days were surprisingly productive. The update would have rolled out sooner if I didn’t have such a hard time with Undo/Redo. The good news is that my team and I are working on something new, and I need your help!

This time I created my own sprite editor named Pixelorama entirely within Godot, using GDScript.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making a Discord Bot with Godot (Part Three)</title><link>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/making-a-discord-bot-with-godot-part-three/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 23:27:32 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.oramainteractive.com/blog/making-a-discord-bot-with-godot-part-three/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a followup tutorial in the &lt;em>“Making a Discord Bot with Godot series“&lt;/em>.
