These last days were surprisingly productive. The update would have rolled out sooner if I didn’t have such a hard time with Undo/Redo. The good news is that my team and I are working on something new, and I need your help! Read until the end to find out what it is! But, for now, v0.4 changelog:

- Undo/Redo, at last! For all the mistakes happy accidents!
- Mirrored drawing both horizontally & vertically.
- Lighten/Darken tool for shading!
- Tool that lets you paint all pixels of the same color, with another color!
- Importing custom brushes from a “Brushes” folder!
- You can now re-name your layers!
- Flip your sprite horizontally or vertically! (Thank you danielnaoexiste from GitHub!)
- You can now remove custom “project” brushes.
- Notification labels that appear when you do an action. For example, if you undo something you drew, a label will appear saying “Undo: Draw”. This one was a last minute addition!

I would also like to give special thanks to Calinou and danielnaoexiste for contributing to Pixelorama’s GitHub repository!
