I have no words. The support we received for Pixelorama v0.5 was too much to handle! We were definitely not expecting so much people showing their genuine interest in our little software, and spreading the word! A lot of people joined [our new Discord server](https://discord.gg/GTMtr8s), left their comments on [Pixelorama's itch.io page](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama) and opened issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama). [Gamefromscratch even made a video on Pixelorama!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-TJ1WcCA6k) This was a massive boost to its popularity, and we'd like to thank them a lot for their awesome video! We'd also like to thank all those who donated through itch.io! Since so many people showed their interest in donating, [we launched a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/OramaInteractive), which can grant people some amazing rewards! You can see our quick announcement video here:

We worked really hard to make sure our new community is pleased, and we are very happy with how v0.6 turned out! What's that? You want to see a changelog? Well, here you go!

Added

- Palettes. You can choose default ones or make your own!  (Thanks to greusser/CheetoHead)
- Multiple theme support to better match your style.
