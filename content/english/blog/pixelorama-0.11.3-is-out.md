Version 0.11.3, another small maintenance update, is here! No new features on this one, but it has very important bug fixes so it is very recommended that you update. Most notably, the previous two versions had a serious issue where using a tool, then switching to another tool and then undoing had no effect. This is now fixed in this version!

Huge thanks to our contributor [Variable](https://github.com/Variable-ind), since he pretty much solved every single bug for this update! More 0.x versions may follow if more serious issues are found and fixed.
