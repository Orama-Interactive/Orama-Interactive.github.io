Hello everyone! We hope you all are doing well. Pixelorama certainly has been! The love and support from the community has been rising, and we are extremely grateful for this. Statistically, we are currently sitting on over 75k downloads and 90k browser plays on itch.io and just a bit less than 3k stars on GitHub.

Since the number of users has been growing a lot, the time for a new update that makes Pixelorama more customizable has arrived. This is why version 0.10 introduces a new User Interface system, that is extremely flexible and customizable. Powered by the [godot-dockable-container plugin](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-dockable-container), you are now able to re-organize and re-order every UI element by dragging the dropping the Tab of each panel around the UI. The individual panels can also be resized, and they can now be hidden from view. You can also choose from pre-made UI layouts, and even create your own. This enables you to customize Pixelorama easily and permanently, without having do re-apply your changes every time you launch the application. Of course, you can always return to the Default layout.

More changes include:

- A totally new UI system. Users can re-arrange all of the panels and place them wherever they want, resize them or hide them from view. It is also possible to save and load custom UI layouts.
- Added an experimental Extensions system that will let the users make their own extensions that add new functionality to Pixelorama. Keep in mind that this is still experimental and backwards compatibility is NOT guaranteed - use at your own risk.
- A new Window menu has been added that has the new UI system options, as well as Zen mode and Fullscreen mode that were previously under the View menu.
- A similarity option has been added to the "same color pixels" mode of the bucket tool.
- The secondary canvas is hidden from view by default, but it can become visible by going to the Window > Panels.
- The mirroring and pixel perfect options are now global tool options and affect both left and right tools.
- Various timeline improvements, like deleting and cloning multiple selected frames and when creating new frames, tags that are in front of them are being pushed. If the currently selected frames are inside a tag, creating new frames makes the tag bigger.
- Drawing with big brush sizes and the "same color pixels" mode of the Bucket tool have been optimized and now run a lot faster.
- And many more! [Read our detailed changelog here](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v010---2022-04-15).

Stay tuned as we are approaching Orama Interactive's 10th anniversary for more exciting announcements. We are preparing a lot of cool stuff for the near future, such as a new project that will take your Pixelorama-made art into a new dimension... Quite literally! ;)
