This took a while. Four months have passed since v0.6, the world has changed drastically, and finally v0.7 is ready to be released. During this time however, one thing was increasing; The support we received from all of you. It fills our hearts with joy to see people being excited about Pixelorama, and to see you all make amazing drawings with it.

I think the highlight of these four months was the `Godot's Desktop/Console Games Showcase video where Pixelorama made it in!` We'd like to thank everyone from the Godot team for including us in the Showcase video, and for creating Godot itself. Without it, Pixelorama would not exist. You can see Godot's Showcase here:

So what has changed? The biggest change is the new timeline. Layers have been merged into it, and it has become cel-based. A cel (celluloid) is an image that refers to a specific layer and frame. Basically, a frame is consisted by multiple cels, each for every layer. This took a long time to implement, because a lot of stuff had to be remade. And to be honest, I wasn't 100% motivated to do it, it felt like a chore having to remake the entire timeline. But eventually I did it and it has been working perfectly so far. I would also like to thank all the people who have contributed for this release. A lot of the new changes would not have been made if it weren't for them. So, what else has changed? Well...

- New cel-based timeline. Layers are now in the timeline.
- Cel linking
- Multiple frame grouping using tags
- Layer locking to prevent changes
- Export animations to .gif (only available for Windows & Linux)
- Major UI overhaul
- Pattern filling option for the bucket tool
- Autosave that keeps backups every x minutes. In the case of a crash, backups can get reloaded to restore work.
- Shortcut binding for tools
- Pixel perfect mode for pencil, eraser and lighten/darken tools
- Layer rotation in the Image menu, with 3 types of rotations
- HSV Adjusting dialog in the Image menu
- Importing .png files as palettes
- A new zoom tool.
- You can move the canvas with arrow keys and zoom with + and -
- The last edited project gets loaded at startup (toggleable in the Preferences), along with a new option in the File menu that also does this
- Confirmation messages appear when exiting, creating a new image or loading the last edited project, if there are unsaved changes.
- More translations
- Improved export window dialog and splash screen
- And many more! [Read our detailed changelog here](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

We are also working on [online Documentation for Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.github.io/Pixelorama-Docs). It's currently a work in progress and is missing a lot of pages, but eventually it will help users who are new to Pixelorama, understand it better!

A while after v0.6 got released, we also launched a [Crowdin project for Pixelorama](https://crowdin.com/project/pixelorama), where all of our translation files are being hosted. If you're interested in translating Pixelorama, check it out!

And, a showcase video for you:

For v0.7, we also hosted our first splash screen art contest in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GTMtr8s). Those who were interested had to join our server, read the rules in the pixelorama-splash-screen channel, and submit their art piece before the deadline! If you are interested in joining the next one (when that time comes), join our awesome Discord community!
