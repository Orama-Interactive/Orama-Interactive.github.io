I swear I wasn’t procrastinating! I was just busy with studying and working on our game! But anyway I’ll keep it short this time, Pixelorama v0.2 is out now and it comes with fancy new things!

- Brand new animation timeline! Add, clone, remove and change order of unlimited frames! The good news? Each frame can have a unique amount of layers, and even be a different size than the rest of the frames!
- New UI for tool options, divided in the left mouse tool and the right mouse tool.
- You can now choose a brush size for pencil and eraser tools! Each mouse button can have its own brush size. You can go wild with this!
- You can import multiple images as different animation frames!
- You can also export the current frame you have selected, or all the frames as multiple files, or as a spritesheet! Supports both horizontal and vertical spritesheets.
- Scaling your image is now functional! And it lets you choose from four different types of interpolation.
- You can toggle a grid in the canvas on and off.
- Added text labels on the bottom right for the frame’s size, the position of the cursor, the zoom level and the currently selected frame.
- Added hints for UI elements.
- Mouse cursor changes depending on where it’s hovering.

Okay, enough words. They say that an image is a thousand of them, right? So… what about a video?
