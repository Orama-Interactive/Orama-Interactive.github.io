It might seem like a long time without an update, but we have been working hard these months to make this update amazing, and we are proud to say that this is probably the biggest update so far! At least until version 1.0, which will most likely be the next major version of Pixelorama!</p><p>Another reason it took so long to release a new update was because we were very busy. My team and I were working on a freelance job in order to make money, which took some time from Pixelorama&rsquo;s development. Pixelorama is a passion project that we work on during our free time, but out free time is not as much as it used to be, so we could definitely use your help! If you wish to support the development process so we can spend more of our time on this amazing project (and future ones!), you can <a href=https://www.patreon.com/OramaInteractive>become a Patron</a> and receive exclusive awards, or <a href=https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama>buy Pixelorama from itch.io</a>! If you don&rsquo;t wish to support us, you can rest easy knowing that no matter what, we will still keep working on Pixelorama for the foreseeable future, and it will always remain free for everyone to use.</p><p><a href=https://patreon.com/OramaInteractive><img alt="Become a patron" src=../../images/blog/become_a_patron.png></a></p><p>Here is an overview of the biggest changes that came with the new version.</p><h2 id=timeline-improvements>Timeline improvements</h2><p>Thanks to <a href=https://github.com/mrtripie>MrTriPie</a>, one of Pixelorama&rsquo;s contributors, the timeline has been refactored behind the scenes. This resulted in a <strong>massive</strong> performance boost when a project has many frames and/or layers. The refactoring also allowed for some well needed feature additions, such as layer groups. Yes, long gone are the days where your timeline was a large pile of layers, with no way to organize them. Now, you can group them together! For more information, see <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/698>#698</a>.</p><h2 id=3d-layers>3D layers</h2><p>The timeline refactoring made it easy to add new layer types in the codebase. One of these new layer types is 3D layers, which made their way to v0.11.
<img alt="Screenshot from Pixelorama&rsquo;s new 3D layers" src=../../images/blog/pixelorama-0.11-is-out/3d_layers.png></p><p>3D layers allow you to break the dimensional barrier, and bring 3D shapes and models into your 2D canvas. You can add a variety of 3D shapes, custom text, three types of lights or a completely custom .obj model, and Pixelorama will automatically pixelate it, depending on the size of your canvas. To help you edit your objects, a new 3D Shape Edit tool has been added, which is only available when a 3D layer is selected. You can use this tool to select an object and move it around, rotate it, scale it, or change any other property from the tool options. All of the editing is non-destructive. If you wish to edit them destructively, you can merge a 3D layer into a pixel layer that is below it, and you can use the familiar draw tools to edit the image to your liking.</p><p>This feature was inspired by certain 3D games that render their 3D geometry in such a way to achieve a pixel art look. 3D layes are still rather basic, and lack some features, such as materials, and the UI/UX still needs some work. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that 3D text is not meant to replace a proper text tool, which will be coming when we add vector layers. For more information, see <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/840>#840</a>.</p><h2 id=reference-images>Reference images</h2><p>Contributor <a href=https://github.com/20kdc>20kdc</a> has added support for reference images to Pixelorama. This allows you to load any kind of image, even high-res images, and use them as references that can help you draw. The reference images are not being included when you export a file, and are not being saved in pxo files due to size reasons. For more information, see <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/771>#771</a>.</p><h2 id=exporting-improvements>Exporting improvements</h2><p>The export dialog window has been overhauled to improve the user experience and to add some new features, such as specific layer exporting, more information at <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/781>#781</a>. v0.11 also comes with APNG (animated png) importing and exporting, thanks to <a href=https://github.com/20kdc>20kdc</a>.</p><h2 id=perspective-editor>Perspective editor</h2><p>Contributor <a href=https://github.com/Variable-ind>Variable</a> has implemented a new perspective editor. This is very useful for artworks that use perspective, for a more 3D look. For more information, see <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/806>#806</a>.</p><h2 id=dynamics>Dynamics</h2><p>After a long time of being work in progress, dynamics, such as tablet pen pessure and mouse/pen velocity are finally here.</p><h2 id=image-effect-improvements>Image effect improvements</h2><p>Rotation now has two new shader-based algorithms, <a href=http://torcado.com/cleanEdge/>cleanEdge</a> and <a href=https://github.com/nobuyukinyuu/godot-omniscale>OmniScale</a>. The latter is only available when using the GLES3 renderer. A new image effect, Posterize, has also been added, which is used to automatically reduce the colors of an image. Certain image properties can now also be animated for multiple cels, thanks to <a href=https://github.com/Variable-ind>Variable</a>. For more info see <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/836>#836</a>.</p><h2 id=new-tools>New tools</h2><p>Version 0.11 comes with new tools, a crop tool, added by <a href=https://github.com/mrtripie>MrTriPie</a> in <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/830>#830</a>, which allows for easy canvas resizing, and a new select by drawing tool, added by <a href=https://github.com/Variable-ind>Variable</a> in <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/792>#792</a>. Variable has also made some improvements in already-existing tools, such as adding a spacing option in the pencil tool (<a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/813>#813</a>), and adding a way to change the selection creation behavior for selection tools from the tool options (<a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/798>#798</a>).</p><h2 id=recorder>Recorder</h2><p>Do you like creating art timelapses? <a href=https://github.com/Variable-ind>Variable</a> has got you covered! This new version comes with a new recorder panel that you can use to automatically record your drawing progress. Pixelorma will save each action you do as a screenshot, which you can later combine into a video. The panel is not visible by default, so if you want to use this, you can go to the Window menu, and on the Panels submenu, click on &ldquo;Recorder&rdquo;. In the future, we could make it so that a video is automatically being created, but that would require ffmpeg being installed on your device. More information at <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/823>#823</a>.</p><h2 id=dropping-support-for-ubuntu-touch>Dropping support for Ubuntu Touch</h2><p>Ubuntu Touch builds have stopped working for some time now, and because I have neither the knowledge nor the time to maintain this platform, I am afraid we have to drop support for it. If in the future supporting Ubuntu Touch becomes easier, or if Godot supports it out of the box, we may start supporting it again.</p><h2 id=full-changelog>Full changelog</h2><h3 id=added>Added</h3><ul><li>Layer groups in the timeline, for better organization. <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/698>#698</a></li><li>Support for reference images has been implemented. <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/771>#771</a></li><li>Specific layer exporting is now possible as part of the export dialog overhaul. <a href=https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/781>#781</a></li><li>3D layers have now been implemented, which allows for non-destructive usage of 3D geometry inside Pixelorama.
