      content : I am Erevoid, co-founder of Orama Interactive and I specialise in Art Direction, Game and UI/UX Design. I enjoy art in its many forms and variations and will always try to learn more and more regarding it, even if it's a stretch of the definition. For art can be found everywhere, you just need to notice it.

I enjoy lots of things, games, series, walks, developing, drawing, but only if they're experiences I can share with my loved ones. I'm extra fun when caffeinated properly.

      designation : Artist
      content : I'm Orion, commonly known as Odnyrion and I joined Orama Interactive because I realized that the people there had a lot of dreams and had taken their career as game developers very seriously, which to me is really inspiring and beautiful. My part in Orama is making concept arts since I have no idea how to program.
